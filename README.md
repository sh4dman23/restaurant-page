# Restaurant Page

![Preview](./images/preview.png)
This is a dummy restaurant page created as a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The
main goal of this project was to make a multi-page site using WebPack to bundle JavaScript files to generate entire
contents of the website.

A live demo of the project is available [here](https://sh4dman23.github.io/restaurant-page).

## Getting Started

# Run this to start a live server
npm run start

# Alternatively, run this to recreate the distribution files

```
Additionally, you can change the menu items in [common.js](./src/common.js).
